    "\n",
    "This program:\n",
    "1. Detects a person's arm in a photo using MediaPipe Pose detection\n",
    "2. Calculates the optimal position, rotation, and scale for a band-aid\n",
    "3. Overlays a realistic band-aid image that matches the arm's angle\n",
    "4. Displays the before and after comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this program with your own photos, you need an image with:\n",
    "- A person clearly visible\n",
    "- At least one arm showing (preferably extended)\n",
    "- Good lighting and contrast\n",
    "- The person facing the camera"

    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The program uses several computer vision techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Pose Detection**\n",
    "- Uses Google's MediaPipe Pose model\n",
    "- Detects 33 body landmarks including shoulders, elbows, and wrists\n",
    "- Works with various poses and angles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Arm Landmark Extraction**\n",
    "- Identifies shoulder, elbow, and wrist positions\n",
    "- Supports both left and right arms\n",
    "- Calculates forearm position and angle\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Band-Aid Transformation**\n",
    "- **Position**: Places band-aid 40% from elbow to wrist\n",
    "- **Rotation**: Matches the arm's angle\n",
    "- **Scale**: Proportional to arm length in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Image Overlay**\n",
    "- Uses alpha blending for realistic transparency\n",
    "- Handles rotation and scaling smoothly\n",
    "- Ensures band-aid stays within image boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Automatic arm detection  \n",
    "âœ… Natural band-aid placement  \n",
    "âœ… Proper scaling and rotation  \n",
    "âœ… Side-by-side comparison  \n",
    "âœ… Works with various poses"
